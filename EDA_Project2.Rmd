The researcherâ€™s major research question is: How have house prices in U.S. states changed over the last few decades, and are changes in prices related to population in some way?  

DATA
** CPI : Consumer price index
  The consumer price index (CPI) is the instrument to measure inflation. It is used to estimate the average variation between two given periods in the prices of products consumed by households. It is a composite measurement of trends in the prices of products, at constant quality. 

** state-abbrevs : two letter code and census region for each state in the US
** Freddie Mac House Price Index : Tracking the average house price in each state since 1975
** Census Data : population data.

1. House prices over time: How have house prices in the U.S changed from 1975 to 2019, after adjusting for inflation, i.e. relative to the CPI? (We stop in 2019 to avoid having to worry about COVID effects.) 
1) How have changes in prices varied by state? 
Which states have seen the biggest increases in real house prices, 
2) and which have seen the biggest decreases? 

3) Have changes in prices within each state mostly followed the same basic pattern, 
and are there outliers to that pattern? 

4) Do the typical patterns vary between the four regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West)?

follows sign curve, peak around 1978, 1987, 2008, down again around 2010 
housing price index start around 100 at the end of year of 2000 thus they converge
